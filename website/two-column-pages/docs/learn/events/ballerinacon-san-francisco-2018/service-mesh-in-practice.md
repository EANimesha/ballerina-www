One of the most complex challenges in realizing microservice architecture is not building the services themselves, but building and governing the communication between services. Most microservices developers have to take care of complex inter-service communication logic as part of their service development.

Service Mesh has emerged as a solution to overcome the challenges that we have in microservices communication. Since most of the inter-service communication requirements are quite generic across all microservices implementations, we can think about offloading all such tasks to a different layer, so that we can keep the service code independent.

In this session, David and Kasun will discuss the following:

- Why we need a Service Mesh?
- Fundamentals of Service Mesh
- Introduction to Istio
- What's new in Istio 1.0.
- Seamless integration of Ballerina and Istio
