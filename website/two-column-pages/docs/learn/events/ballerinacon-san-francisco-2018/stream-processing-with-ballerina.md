Organizations that can make sense out of massive amounts of data produced by systems, customers, or partners will have a competitive edge. Ballerina Stream Processing provides real-time event stream processing capabilities to microservices, with intuitive SQL queries allowing users to filter, aggregate and correlate data to make sense, take decisions and act in real-time in a distributed manner.

In this talk, we will discuss the following:

- Ballerina’s Stream Processing capability.
- How can it be used for real-time decision making?
- Building highly scalable data pipelines with data processing at the edge.
- Building event-driven architecture with stream processing.
- The roadmap.
