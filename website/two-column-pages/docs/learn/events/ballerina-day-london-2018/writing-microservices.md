With the massive adoption of microservices and serverless functions-based cloud native architectures, the need for cloud native programming languages is on the rise. Today, the apps we write increasingly integrate with programmable endpoints such as data, microservices, APIs, and serverless functions. Yet, with existing languages, developers have to take responsibility to solve the hard problems of integration such as security, resiliency, transactions, stream processing, workflows, protocol handling, data formats, and mediation.

Ballerina is a cloud native programming language specializing in integration. It makes the development of microservices that integrate with other systems simpler by bringing fundamental concepts, ideas, and tools of distributed system integration into the language.

In this session, we will give you an in-depth overview of Ballerina’s language features: high-level network abstractions such as endpoints, services and resources, network-aware type system, error handling, and the concurrency model built on the sequence diagram metaphor.
