Docker and Kubernetes are key elements of modern cloud native deployment automations. After building your microservices, the common practice is to create docker images and create YAML files to automate the deployment with Docker and Kubernetes. Writing these YAMLs and Dockerfile descriptors are really painful and error prone.

Ballerina understands the architecture around it; the compiler is environment aware with microservices directly deployable into infrastructures such as Docker and Kubernetes. This session will explore how Ballerina helps to orchestrate microservices into Kubernetes without writing YAMLs and Dockerfiles.
