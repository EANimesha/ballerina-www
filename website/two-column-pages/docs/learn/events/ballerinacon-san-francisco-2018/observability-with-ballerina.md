Observability has become a key aspect in our software architectures, where the ability to track and understand the state of the applications has proven useful in managing the overall health of a system. Ballerina provides inbuilt observability features, and users can automatically obtain feedback and the statistics on how their programs are running. This makes the lives of an engineers much easier as they can track and predict the behavior of the system and fine tune it for maximum efficiency. This also helps to avoid any possible impending failures.
