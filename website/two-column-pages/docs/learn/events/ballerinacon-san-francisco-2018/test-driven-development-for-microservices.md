Test driven development (TDD) emphasizes test-first development. What happens when you apply TDD to a programming language that generates hosted microservices operating against different protocols?

In this session, Lynn and Tyler will discuss methods to apply TDD to various types of endpoints and they will present Testerina, a built-in unit testing framework for Ballerina. They will also present and demo Ballerina sample code that tests both Ballerina services and integration with external services. The speakers will also discuss Testerina features, such as before/after execution, data-driven testing, test ordering, and functional service mocks.
