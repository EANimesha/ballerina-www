Cloud native programming inherently involves working with remote endpoints: microservices, serverless, APIs, WebSockets, SaaS apps, and more. Ballerina is a new programming language that is designed to bring code-first agility to the challenge of integrating across endpoints. As we know, one of the fallacies of distributed computing is "the network is reliable". Resilience is the ability to recover to a working condition after being affected by a serious incident. Integration programmers have to be aware of such failures and also make their programs robust to deal with and recover from such failures.

In this session, Afkham will look at how Ballerina helps integration developers write resilient programs and how it helps eliminate or reduce failures due to oversight. He will also demonstrate core resiliency techniques, such as timeout, retry, circuit breaker, distributed transactions, and others.
