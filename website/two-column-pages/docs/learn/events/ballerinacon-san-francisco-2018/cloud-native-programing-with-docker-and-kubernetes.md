Docker and Kubernetes are key elements of modern cloud native deployment automations. After building your microservices, common practice is to create docker images and YAML files to automate the deployment with Docker and Kubernetes. Writing these YAMLs and Dockerfile descriptors are painful and error prone.

Ballerina is a new cloud native programing language that understands the architecture around it; the compiler is environment aware and microservices deploy directly onto Docker and Kubernetes.

In this session, Lakmal will explore Ballerina's deployment automation capabilities. Most of the talk will be a live demo, and he will also discuss the motivation for creating a new cloud native programing language and its design inspirations.
