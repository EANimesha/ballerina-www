Ballerina is an attempt to build a modern industrial-grade programming language. One of its key objectives is to make microservices and integration-heavy programming simpler by baking integration concepts into the language, such as a network-aware type system, first-class network services, and resources along with functions/objects, distributed transactions, stream processing, etc.

In this session, Sameera will discuss and demonstrate how Ballerina simplifies your microservices development. Also, he will show you how Ballerina helps you to achieve agility and integration simplicity with its first-class integration syntax and environmental deployment constructs.
