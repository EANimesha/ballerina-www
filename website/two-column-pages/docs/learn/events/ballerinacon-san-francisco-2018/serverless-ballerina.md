Serverless computing is becoming increasingly popular in cloud native development. It provides advantages to an organization in terms of cost, scalability, and agility. Ballerina was created to make integrations simple. It also adds agility to the development process. What will happen when Ballerina meets serverless? A couple of serverless platforms have already started supporting Ballerina as a runtime.

In this talk, Rodric, Adnan and Amila will speak about the advantages of adopting a serverless strategy, the work they have done in running Ballerina in OpenWhisk and Kubeless, and other efforts going on to support Ballerina in the serverless world.
