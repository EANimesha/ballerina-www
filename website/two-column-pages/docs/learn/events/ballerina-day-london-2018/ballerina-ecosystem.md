In this session, we will look at how Ballerina is integrated with and supported by external tools and technologies. Some of these technologies are gRPC, Kafka, Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, and integrations to other products such as Codefresh as a CI/CD solution, Kubeless, OpenWhisk and KNative as serverless platforms, and Istio integration for service mesh support. The Ballerina ecosystem is an integral part of the language's development, as it facilitates wider user adoption and innovation.
